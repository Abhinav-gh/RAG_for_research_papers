the long, thin package he had brought with them. “Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!”

SMASH! The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with
a deafening crash landed flat on the floor. A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost
completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard,
but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair. The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just
brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily
back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little."

"19. ""The Dursleys take Harry to the train station and Uncle Vernon is mean.""","“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon. “Got to have that
ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.”
Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous
to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want
to walk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d change on the train. He
checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he
needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the
room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy
trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley
into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off. They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s
trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this
was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms
with a nasty grin on his face. “Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform
should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet,
do they?”
He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one
platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the
middle, nothing at all. “Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile."

he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every
word — like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class
silent without effort. “As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of

Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek,
Potter.”
Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to
cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh
dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except
Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the
perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green
smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed
to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping
across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within seconds, the
whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been
drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry
red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. “Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave
of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the
cauldron off the fire?”
Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. “Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Seamus. Then he
rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville. “You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought
he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That’s another point
you’ve lost for Gryffindor.”
This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked
him behind their cauldron. "

Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron
turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was
almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on
its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry
safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good — every time they got
near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled
beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the
Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing. “Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately. Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and
was now racing along the row behind him; she didn’t even stop to say sorry as
she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching
Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-
chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of
Snape’s robes. It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A
sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a
little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row — Snape would
never know what had happened."

THE WORST BIRTHDAY
ot for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at

chance. . . . I don’t like the sound of that school food. ."

“Good for you,” said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone was
patting him on the back as though he’d just won a marathon; Fred and George
pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, “Why couldn’t
we’ve come in the car, eh?” Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning
embarrassedly, but Harry could see one person who didn’t look happy at all. Percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to
be trying to get near enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged Ron in the
ribs and nodded in Percy’s direction. Ron got the point at once. “Got to get upstairs — bit tired,” he said, and the two of them started
pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room, which led to
a spiral staircase and the dormitories. “’Night,” Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl just
like Percy’s. They managed to get to the other side of the common room, still having
their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase. They hurried up it,

had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS. They entered the familiar, circular
room, with its five four-posters hung with red velvet and its high, narrow

Here are 20 unique user queries that could retrieve or refer to the provided document chunk:,"Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the

the bench. When Harry had taken his place between Ron and Hermione, she
said, “We’ll be repotting Mandrakes today. Now, who can tell me the
properties of the Mandrake?”
To nobody’s surprise, Hermione’s hand was first into the air. “Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,” said Hermione,
sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook. “It is used to
return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state.”
“Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,” said Professor Sprout. “The

and looked over at Colin’s bed, but it had been blocked from view by the high
curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday. Seeing that he was awake,
Madam Pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began
bending and stretching his arm and fingers. “All in order,” she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge left-handed. “When you’ve finished eating, you may leave.”
Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower,
desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby, but they weren’t
there. Harry left to look for them, wondering where they could have got to
and feeling slightly hurt that they weren’t interested in whether he had his
bones back or not. As Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled out of it, looking in far
better spirits than last time they’d met. “Oh, hello, Harry,” he said. “Excellent flying yesterday, really excellent. Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup — you earned fifty

Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had only seconds, Harry
straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it landed right on target
in Goyle’s cauldron. Goyle’s potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked as
splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and his nose
began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his hands over his
eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate — Snape was trying to
restore calm and find out what had happened. Through the confusion, Harry
saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape’s office. “Silence! SILENCE!” Snape roared. “Anyone who has been splashed,
come here for a Deflating Draught — when I find out who did this —”

drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the class
lumbered up to Snape’s desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs,

slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes bulging. When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had
subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle’s cauldron and scooped out the twisted
black remains of the firework. There was a sudden hush. “If I ever find out who threw this,” Snape whispered, “I shall make sure
that person is expelled.”
Harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression. Snape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten minutes later could
not have been more welcome. “He knew it was me,” Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back

Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had only seconds, Harry
straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it landed right on target
in Goyle’s cauldron. Goyle’s potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked as
splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and his nose
began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his hands over his
eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate — Snape was trying to
restore calm and find out what had happened. Through the confusion, Harry
saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape’s office. “Silence! SILENCE!” Snape roared. “Anyone who has been splashed,
come here for a Deflating Draught — when I find out who did this —”
Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head
drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the class
lumbered up to Snape’s desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs,
others unable to talk through gigantic puffed-up lips, Harry saw Hermione
slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes bulging. When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had
subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle’s cauldron and scooped out the twisted
black remains of the firework. There was a sudden hush. “If I ever find out who threw this,” Snape whispered, “I shall make sure
that person is expelled.”
Harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression. Snape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten minutes later could
not have been more welcome. “He knew it was me,” Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back
to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. “I could tell.”
