Question 1: Who is Voldemort and why is he feared?
Answer:
Voldemort is described as a wizard who went "bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse." He is also referred to as "my master" and "a great wizard" by Quirrell. The context states that he has killed many people.

He is feared because people are "still scared" of him, and they often refer to him as "You-Know-Who" because they are frightened of saying his name. Dumbledore notes that everyone knows he is the only one Voldemort was frightened of. His power "somehow broke" when he couldn't kill Harry Potter.

lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying
‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying
Voldemort’s name.”
“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the
only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.”
“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will
never have.”

Question 3: How did Harry survive the killing curse as a baby?
Answer:
When Voldemort tried to kill Harry Potter as a baby, he couldn't, and Voldemort's power somehow broke. Professor McGonagall found it astounding that of all things, a little boy could stop him. Dumbledore states that they can only guess how Harry survived and may never know. The context also mentions that Harry's mother was trying to protect him.

when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke —
and that’s why he’s gone.”
Dumbledore nodded glumly.
“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done . . .
all the people he’s killed . . . he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just
astounding . . . of all the things to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven
did Harry survive?”
“We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.”

stuff fer school.”
Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just
thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside
him had got a puncture.
“Um — Hagrid?”
“Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.
“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night . . . he
won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.”
“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head.
