Question 1: Who is Voldemort and why is he feared?
Answer:
Voldemort is a powerful wizard who started gaining followers about twenty years ago, causing "Dark days" where people didn't know who to trust or dare to get friendly with strange wizards or witches. He is referred to as "Lord Voldemort" by his follower Quirrell, who considers him a "great wizard" and his "master." Voldemort believes "there is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it." He had powers Dumbledore says he will never have, and Dumbledore is described as the "only one Voldemort was frightened of." He is still "out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share."

Voldemort is feared because of the "dark days" he caused. People are so afraid of him that they often avoid saying his name, referring to him as "You-Know-Who," as Dumbledore explains that "Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself." Hagrid gulps and shudders at the mention of his name, and Professor McGonagall flinches. Harry also starts to feel "a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned." People get scared "in case You-Know-Who’s behind" bad events. Hagrid describes him as "bad," "as bad as you could go," "Worse. Worse than worse."

Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. “Could you write it down?” Harry suggested. “Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.” Hagrid shuddered. “Don’
make me say it again. Anyway, this — this wizard, about twenty years ago
now, started lookin’ fer followers. Got ’em, too — some were afraid, some
just wanted a bit o’ his power, ’cause he was gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with
strange wizards or witches . .

ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room. “The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours. “The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair. “I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.”
She left the chamber.

Question 3: How did Harry survive the killing curse as a baby?
Answer:
The context states that "You-Know-Who" (Voldemort) tried to kill Harry as a baby with a powerful, evil curse, but "he couldn’t do it." The curse "took care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no one except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches an’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you lived.” The mark on Harry's forehead is what he got when this curse touched him.

However, the provided context does not explain the specific reason or mechanism by which Harry survived the killing curse. It only states that the curse "didn't work on him."

. “You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then — an’ this is the real myst’ry of the
thing — he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose,
or maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do it. Never wondered
how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s
what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer
mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why
yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no one
except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches an’ wizards of the age —
the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you
lived.”
Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. As Hagrid’s story
came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly
than he had ever remembered it before — and he remembered something else,
for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. Hagrid was watching him sadly. “Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders. Brought
yeh ter this lot . . .”
“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost
forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have
got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched. “Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept there’s something strange
