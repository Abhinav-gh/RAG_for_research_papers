Question 1: Who is Voldemort and why is he feared?
Answer:
Voldemort is a powerful wizard who, about twenty years ago, started looking for followers and gained significant power, leading to "Dark days." He is referred to as "Lord Voldemort" by Quirrell, who considers him his "master" and a "great wizard." Quirrell states that Voldemort taught him that "there is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it." Voldemort is still "out there somewhere," potentially looking for another body to share, and is currently with Quirrell wherever he goes. He is rumored to have turned up in Godric's Hollow and caused the deaths of Lily and James Potter. Dumbledore acknowledges that Voldemort had powers he will never have.

Voldemort is feared for several reasons. During the "Dark days" he caused, people didn't know who to trust and didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches. People are so afraid of him that they often avoid saying his name, referring to him as "You-Know-Who," as "fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself." Professor McGonagall states that "everyone knows" Dumbledore is the only one Voldemort was frightened of, implying widespread fear among others. People get scared when unsettling events happen, in case "You-Know-Who’s behind it." Harry also gets "a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned."

Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. “Could you write it down?” Harry suggested. “Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.” Hagrid shuddered. “Don’
make me say it again. Anyway, this — this wizard, about twenty years ago
now, started lookin’ fer followers. Got ’em, too — some were afraid, some
just wanted a bit o’ his power, ’cause he was gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with
strange wizards or witches . .

ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room. “The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours. “The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair. “I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.”
She left the chamber.

Question 3: How did Harry survive the killing curse as a baby?
Answer:
The context states that You-Know-Who tried to kill Harry as a baby, but "he couldn't do it" and the powerful, evil curse "didn't work on" Harry. It is described as "the real myst'ry of the thing." Harry survived, and the curse left him with the mark on his forehead. The context does not provide a specific reason or explanation for *how* he survived, only that he did when no one else had.

. “You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then — an’ this is the real myst’ry of the
thing — he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose,
or maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do it. Never wondered
how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s
what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer
mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why
yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no one
except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches an’ wizards of the age —
the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you
lived.”
Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. As Hagrid’s story
came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly
than he had ever remembered it before — and he remembered something else,
for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. Hagrid was watching him sadly. “Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders. Brought
yeh ter this lot . . .”
“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost
forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have
got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched. “Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept there’s something strange

Question 4: Describe the scene where Harry buys his school supplies in Diagon Alley.
Answer:
The context provides information about Harry's experience in Diagon Alley related to school supplies.

Harry was in Diagon Alley (Page 51). He saw mounds of gold coins and columns of silver inside a place unlocked by Griphook (Page 63).

Harry visited a shop called Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C., which was the last shop he went to and what he had been really looking forward to (Page 68). The shop was narrow and shabby with peeling gold letters over the door. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. When they stepped inside, a tinkling bell rang. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair where Hagrid sat. Harry felt as though he had entered a very strict library and looked at thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly (Page 68).

The context does not describe Harry buying other school supplies, only his visit to Ollivanders and acquiring money.

CHAPTER  FIVE
DIAGON ALLEY
arry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was
daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. “It was a dream,” he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a giant called Hagrid
came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll
be at home in my cupboard.”
There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart
sinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. Tap. Tap.

Question 5: List and describe all spells used.
Answer:
One spell is mentioned as being used:
*   **"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow."** - This spell was attempted by Ron, but nothing happened. The rat, Scabbers, remained gray and asleep.
